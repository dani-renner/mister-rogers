## Specifications

* Describe: beepBoop()
* Test: Returns a string that counts from 0 up to what the user entered, replacing numbers that contain '3' as one (or more) of the digits with the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?", numbers that contains '2' as one (or more) of the digits with the phrase "Boop!" and numbers that contain '1' as one (or more) of the digits with the phrase with "Beep!". It maintains a hierarchy within the exception rules (3s trump 2s, which trump 1s).
* Expect: beepBoop(13).toEqual(["0", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?")]
